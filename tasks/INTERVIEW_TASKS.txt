TASK 4: "Berlin" — Binary Detective
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

OBJECTIVE:
Fix a mysterious binary that crashes with minimal information.

SITUATION:
A binary called `mystery` in your home directory initializes but then
shows "Status: locked" and exits with code 1.

You DON'T have the source code. You must use debugging tools to
determine what's missing.

GIVEN:
- Binary at: ~/mystery

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Determine WHY the binary crashes
2. Fix the issue so the binary runs successfully
3. The binary will print a VERIFICATION CODE when it works
4. Copy the verification code to your solution file
5. Save your solution to: ~/solutions/berlin.txt

Your solution file format:
Line 1: The VERIFICATION CODE (exactly as printed)
Line 2+: Your investigation explanation (tools used, what was wrong, how you fixed it)
